# Malicious Mex

The example code here is super scuffed and just frankenstein-ing the bare minimum code needed for a valid mex function, and then shoving my existing templates (taken from Sektor7, love those people) into the file. Definitely better, stealthier ways to go about it, but this is a proof of concept I made in ~30-60 mins, most of which was spent reading.

## Compiling
To compile a mex function, all you have to do is open this folder in MATLAB, and from the MATLAB command prompt
```shell
>> mex <SOURCE_CODE.c>
```

This [NASA page](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/compiling-matlab-scripts-into-executables-to-reduce-the-use-of-licenses_527.html) explains how to compile a script. If I had access to the compiler I'd be able to give solid instructions, but I can only do as good as this for now.

```shell
>> mcc -m implant.m -o implant.exe
```

## Running Without Compiling
You'll still have to compile the mex function, but once you do that, all you have to do is call the script's name from the command prompt.

```shell
>> implant
```
